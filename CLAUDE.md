# CLAUDE.md - REBUILD PROGRESS TRACKER

AI assistance context for pharmaceutical production management system - **REBUILD IN PROGRESS**

## üö® CURRENT REBUILD STATUS
**Phase**: üöß **POST-INCIDENT STRATEGIC REBUILD**  
**Progress**: 0% - Infrastructure Security Foundation Required  
**Next**: PRIORITY 0.0 Infrastructure Automation (MANDATORY FIRST)  
**Previous Code**: ‚ùå LOST - 20+ hours of implementation destroyed  
**Rebuild Strategy**: ‚úÖ ENHANCED with enterprise infrastructure security

## üõ°Ô∏è INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY FOUNDATION (P0.0 - IN PROGRESS)
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED - HIGHEST PRIORITY  
**Requirement**: Eliminate manual operations to prevent future code loss

### P0.0 Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployments, no manual server access
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code**: Docker compositions version-controlled
- [ ] **Branch Protection Rules**: Master branch protection, require PRs
- [ ] **Automated Environment Recreation**: Complete environment from git only
- [ ] **Zero Manual Operations Policy**: Technical prevention of manual server manipulation

## üìã REBUILD PHASES (PENDING P0.0 COMPLETION)

### ‚ùå Phase 1: Project Foundation (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] apps/backend directory structure
- [ ] package.json with NestJS dependencies
- [ ] TypeScript configuration (strict mode)
- [ ] ESLint, Prettier configuration
- [ ] Docker infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch)

### ‚ùå Phase 2: Database & Prisma (NOT STARTED) 
- [ ] Prisma schema with core models
- [ ] GxP data versioning schema (ProcessVersion, ProductionLineVersion)
- [ ] Database migrations and seeding
- [ ] Version-controlled schema evolution

### ‚ùå Phase 3: Core Services (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Prisma service with optimized connections
- [ ] Audit service with transaction support
- [ ] Authentication system (JWT + RBAC)
- [ ] Authorization guards and decorators
- [ ] User management service

### ‚ùå Phase 4: Production Entities (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] ProductionLine service with versioning
- [ ] Process service with pharmaceutical workflows
- [ ] GraphQL resolvers with DataLoader optimization
- [ ] Complete CRUD operations with audit trail

### ‚ùå Phase 5: Performance & Security (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Redis caching with intelligent invalidation
- [ ] Database monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Audit archiving (PostgreSQL ‚Üí Elasticsearch)
- [ ] Security headers and input sanitization
- [ ] Application monitoring and metrics

### ‚ùå Phase 6: Testing Infrastructure (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Jest configuration and test utilities
- [ ] Authentication tests (33 tests target)
- [ ] Audit trail tests (21 tests target) 
- [ ] GraphQL API tests (31 tests target)
- [ ] Integration and E2E test suites

### ‚ùå Phase 7: Performance Testing (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] k6 performance framework
- [ ] Load testing scenarios (100+ users target)
- [ ] Performance validation (P95 < 200ms target)
- [ ] Cache performance testing

### ‚ùå Phase 8: GxP Compliance (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] **P0.1**: Data versioning service (immutable records)
- [ ] **P0.2**: Complete audit trail (mandatory "Why" parameter)
- [ ] **P0.3**: ApprovalWorkflowService & QUALITY_ASSURANCE role
- [ ] **P0.4**: Electronic signatures (21 CFR Part 11)

## üéØ REFERENCE SPECIFICATIONS
- **CLAUDE_SPECIFICATION.md**: Original system specification (20+ hours of work)
- **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE_SPECIFICATION.md**: Original development workflows
- **COMPREHENSIVE_REBUILD_TODO.md**: Complete rebuild checklist (150+ items)
- **COMPLIANCE-FIRST-PLAN.md**: Enhanced compliance plan with infrastructure security

## üìä REBUILD METRICS
**Total Items**: ~150+ major implementation items  
**Completed**: 0 items  
**Current Progress**: 0.0%  
**Infrastructure Security**: ‚ùå Not implemented  
**Code Foundation**: ‚ùå Not started  
**GxP Compliance**: ‚ùå Pending foundation completion

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS
1. **YOU**: Run git commands to commit this progress tracker
2. **INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST**: Implement P0.0 infrastructure security
3. **Foundation**: Begin Phase 1 project structure rebuild
4. **Verification**: Compare rebuilt system against specifications

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS
- **NO GIT OPERATIONS**: Claude is banned from all git commands
- **INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST**: P0.0 must be completed before any code development
- **SAFETY PROTOCOL**: Frequent commits after every major milestone
- **VERIFICATION**: Check GitHub after every commit to ensure files exist
