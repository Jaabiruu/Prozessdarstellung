# PHASE 4: PRODUCTION ENTITIES TODO (SIMPLIFIED)

**Created**: December 22, 2025  
**Status**: ACTIVE - REFACTORED FOR DISPLAY-ONLY APP  
**Purpose**: Track simplified Production Entities implementation  
**Total Tasks**: 4 major items

## üéØ PHASE 4 OBJECTIVES (SIMPLIFIED)
- P4.1: ProductionLine service with standard CRUD and GraphQL layer
- P4.2: Process service with standard CRUD and GraphQL layer  
- P4.3: GraphQL optimization with DataLoader (N+1 prevention)
- P4.4: Integration and verification

**REFACTOR NOTE**: Removed complex GxP versioning, workflow management, and pharmaceutical-specific validation since this app displays already verified GxP data from external sources.

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### ‚úÖ P4.0: Setup & Planning
- [x] **TODO Management**: Create Phase 4 TODO file (MANDATORY for >2 subtasks)
- [x] **TodoWrite Integration**: Initialize progress tracking system

### üîÑ P4.1: ProductionLine Service & GraphQL Layer
- [ ] **ProductionLine Service**: `src/production-line/production-line.service.ts`
  - Implement standard CRUD methods: create, update, findOne, findAll, and deactivate (soft-delete)
  - All data-modifying methods must be wrapped in a Prisma transaction that includes the corresponding audit log creation
- [ ] **ProductionLine Resolver**: `src/production-line/production-line.resolver.ts`
  - Implement GraphQL @Query for productionLines (paginated) and productionLine
  - Implement @Mutation for createProductionLine, updateProductionLine, and deactivateProductionLine
  - Secure all mutations and queries with appropriate @Roles() decorators
  - Implement DataLoader in the processes resolver field to prevent N+1 issues
- [ ] **DTOs**: Create create-production-line.input.ts and update-production-line.input.ts with validation
- [ ] **VERIFICATION**: All GraphQL operations for ProductionLine work as expected, are secured, and create a corresponding audit trail entry
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat(production-line): Implement full CRUD service and GraphQL layer"

### üîÑ P4.2: Process Service & GraphQL Layer (SIMPLIFIED)
- [ ] **Process Service**: `src/process/process.service.ts`
  - Implement standard CRUD methods: create, update, findOne, findAllByProductionLine, and deactivate (soft-delete)
  - Ensure all data-modifying methods are transactional with the audit log
- [ ] **Process Resolver**: `src/process/process.resolver.ts`
  - Implement @Query for processes (paginated) and process
  - Implement @Mutation for createProcess, updateProcess, and deactivateProcess
  - Secure mutations with @Roles() decorators
- [ ] **DTOs**: Create create-process.input.ts and update-process.input.ts with validation
- [ ] **VERIFICATION**: All GraphQL operations for Process work correctly, are linked to a ProductionLine, and are fully audited
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat(process): Implement full CRUD service and GraphQL layer"

### üîÑ P4.3: GraphQL Optimization & DataLoader
- [ ] **DataLoader Implementation**: Create DataLoaders for N+1 query prevention
- [ ] **GraphQL Context**: Integrate DataLoaders into GraphQL context
- [ ] **Resolver Optimization**: Update resolvers to use DataLoaders for relationships
- [ ] **VERIFICATION**: Confirm no N+1 queries in production line ‚Üî process relationships
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat(graphql): Implement DataLoader optimization for N+1 prevention"

### üîÑ P4.4: Integration & Final Verification
- [ ] **AppModule Integration**: Register all new modules in AppModule
- [ ] **GraphQL Schema**: Verify complete schema generation and accessibility
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete CRUD workflows
- [ ] **Enterprise Standards**: Verify compliance with coding standards
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat(phase4): Complete Production Entities implementation"

## üõ°Ô∏è SIMPLIFIED COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

### Core Requirements (Simplified)
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection (never manual instantiation)
- [ ] **Database Operations**: All mutations use transactions with audit logging
- [ ] **GraphQL Resolvers**: Use DataLoader for relationships (N+1 prevention)
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Structured error handling with proper GraphQL responses
- [ ] **Security**: Role-based validation on all mutations
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types and validation

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Transaction Support**: All CRUD operations are transactional
- [ ] **DataLoader Pattern**: No N+1 queries in GraphQL resolvers
- [ ] **DTO Validation**: Proper input validation on all operations
- [ ] **Security**: Appropriate @Roles() decorators on mutations

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKING

**Current Status**: Setup complete, ready for simplified implementation  
**Next Action**: Refactor existing code to match simplified requirements  
**Completion Target**: All 4 major tasks completed and tested

## üîÑ LIFECYCLE STATUS

**Phase**: Implementation (Simplified)  
**Testing**: USER testing required after completion  
**Review**: Joint USER/AI verification required  
**Archive**: Both parties must approve archival

## üö® REFACTOR NOTES

**REMOVED**: 
- Complex GxP versioning (version field increment logic)
- Pharmaceutical workflow validation
- Complex business rule validation  
- Process status/progress validation logic
- Reason field requirements (simplified to optional)

**KEPT**:
- Basic CRUD operations
- Transaction support with audit logging
- Role-based security
- DataLoader optimization
- Standard input validation

**IMPORTANT**: This file will be moved to `archived_md/todos/` only after USER testing and approval.
