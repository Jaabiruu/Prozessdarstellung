Pillar 3: Testing Architectural Cleanliness (REFACTOR-ARCH)
Goal: To ensure the refactored code correctly adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY).

Test ID: ARCH-001

Description: Verify SRP in ProductionLineService.
Test Type: Static Review / Unit
Preconditions: N/A
Steps: 1. Review the ProductionLineService file. 2. Attempt to call productionLineService.findProcessesByProductionLine in a test.
Expected Result: The method findProcessesByProductionLine does not exist in the service, causing a compile-time or runtime error.
Focus: [Architecture]
Test ID: ARCH-002

Description: Verify SRP in ProductionLineResolver.
Test Type: Static Review / E2E
Preconditions: N/A
Steps: 1. Inspect the generated schema.gql. 2. Attempt to send a top-level processesByProductionLine GraphQL query.
Expected Result: The query processesByProductionLine does not exist in the schema. The GraphQL server returns a validation error.
Focus: [Architecture]
Test ID: ARCH-003

Description: Verify DRY with @AuditContext decorator.
Test Type: Integration
Preconditions: A mutation in any refactored resolver.
Steps: 1. Call a mutation (e.g., updateUser). 2. In the test, mock the AuditService and spy on its create method.
Expected Result: The AuditService.create method is called with an auditData object that correctly contains the IP address and user-agent, proving the decorator worked.
Focus: [Happy Path]
