Pillar 2: Testing Performance & Efficiency (REFACTOR-PERF)
Goal: To verify that redundant database queries have been eliminated and resolvers are efficient.

Test ID: PERF-001

Description: Verify query reduction in update methods.
Test Type: Integration
Preconditions: A ProductionLine record exists. Mock the prisma.productionLine client to count calls.
Steps: 1. Call the refactored productionLineService.update method.
Expected Result: The mocked findUnique or findFirst method is called 0 times. The update method is called 1 time. This proves the pre-emptive read was removed.
Focus: [CRITICAL]
Test ID: PERF-002

Description: Verify processCount field resolver efficiency.
Test Type: Integration
Preconditions: A ProductionLine is created with a _count property. Mock the context.dataloaders object.
Steps: 1. Execute a GraphQL query for a ProductionLine and its processCount field.
Expected Result: The resolver function returns the count from parent._count.processes and makes zero calls to any DataLoader or service.
Focus: [Performance]
Test ID: PERF-003

Description: N+1 query prevention remains effective.
Test Type: Integration
Preconditions: 5 ProductionLines and 15 Processes exist. Enable query logging.
Steps: 1. Execute the GraphQL query to fetch 5 lines and their nested processes.
Expected Result: Exactly 2 database queries are logged.
Focus: [Regression]
