## üö® CRITICAL SAFETY RULES (UNCHANGED)

### **GIT OPERATIONS - CLAUDE IS BANNED**
- **YOU ARE FORBIDDEN from running ANY git commands**
- User will handle ALL: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
- After each major milestone, tell user EXACTLY what git commands to run

### **SAFETY PROTOCOL**
- Commit after EVERY major milestone
- Push immediately to GitHub
- Verify files exist on GitHub before continuing
- NO batch commits - commit frequently

### **ENTERPRISE STANDARDS COMPLIANCE**
- ALL code must follow the established SDLC Policy (13 sections)
- Use readonly interfaces, union types, secure configuration patterns
- Follow NestJS dependency injection patterns
- Implement proper error handling and logging

---

## üìã IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

### **YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK**:
1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** to understand current progress (should show 18% complete with Phase 2 done)
2. **Read `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`** to see Phase 2 completion and Phase 3 planning
3. **Read `REBUILD_PROGRESS.md`** to see comprehensive Phase 1&2 completion status
4. **Start Phase 3.1**: Create authentication system with JWT + RBAC
5. **Follow SDLC Policy**: Use established 14-section enterprise standards for all code

### **DO NOT**:
- Skip reading current progress documentation (all files updated to 18%)
- Ignore enterprise standards established in Phase 1&2
- Create code that doesn't follow the SDLC Policy (including Section 14)
- Implement GraphQL resolvers yet (Phase 4)

## üìû CONTEXT VERIFICATION QUESTIONS

**Ask yourself these questions to verify context understanding:**

1. ‚úÖ Do I understand Phase 1 & 2 are COMPLETE and Phase 3 is READY TO START?
2. ‚úÖ Do I know the current progress is 18% complete (18/150 items)?
3. ‚úÖ Do I understand I'm BANNED from git operations?
4. ‚úÖ Do I know I need to start P3.1 Authentication System (JWT + RBAC)?
5. ‚úÖ Do I understand all code must follow the established 14-section SDLC Policy?
6. ‚úÖ Do I know the difference between ACTIVE docs vs REFERENCE specs?
7. ‚úÖ Do I understand the database foundation is complete and tested?
8. ‚úÖ Do I understand the security enhancements (environment-based configuration)?
9. ‚úÖ Do I understand the architectural improvements (Terminus patterns, global modules)?

**If you answered YES to all 9 questions, you're ready to start Phase 3.**

## üöÄ STARTUP COMMAND FOR NEW CLAUDE

**Say this to confirm context understanding:**

> "I understand the pharmaceutical system rebuild context. Phase 1 & 2 are COMPLETE with enterprise standards and database foundation established (18% progress). The database schema, PrismaService, secure data seeding, and module integration are all complete with security enhancements. I need to start Phase 3 Core Services: P3.1 Authentication System (JWT + RBAC), following the established 14-section SDLC Policy including the new health check and monitoring standards. I am banned from git operations. I will read CLAUDE.md, DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md, and REBUILD_PROGRESS.md to verify current progress, then begin Phase 3 implementation. Ready to start Phase 3 Core Services of the strategic rebuild."
