# ü§ñ AI ASSISTANT HANDOFF - PHARMACEUTICAL SYSTEM

**Copy this to a fresh Claude instance to continue development**

---

## üìö QUICK START FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**Current Status**: Phase 1-4 complete + verified (40%) + ACTIVE enterprise architectural refactoring - Pillar 1 Atomicity 100% complete + GraphQL enum conflict RESOLVED

### **Essential Reading Order**:
1. üìã **`README.md`** - Project overview and setup guide
2. ‚≠ê **`CLAUDE.md`** - AI context and critical development rules (90% smaller!)
3. üìÅ **`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`** - Current progress and phase tracking
4. üîß **`COMPREHENSIVE_REBUILD_TODO.md`** - Implementation details (Phase 4+ only)
5. üèóÔ∏è **`docs/ENTERPRISE_STANDARDS.md`** - Complete SDLC policy and coding standards
6. üß™ **`docs/TESTING_ERRORS_AND_SOLUTIONS.md`** - Critical testing blockers and solutions

## üö® CRITICAL AI RULES

- ‚ùå **NO GIT COMMANDS** - User handles ALL git operations (commits, pushes, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Follow Enterprise Standards** - Complete SDLC policy now in `docs/ENTERPRISE_STANDARDS.md`
- ‚úÖ **GraphQL-Only Architecture** - No REST controllers anywhere
- ‚úÖ **Use TodoWrite Tool** - Track progress and plan tasks frequently
- ‚úÖ **TODO File Management** - Create separate files in `todos/` for phases with >2 subtasks
- ‚úÖ **Redis Available** - Use ioredis for JWT blocklist and caching

## üéØ NEXT ACTIONS

**ARCHITECTURAL REFACTORING IN PROGRESS** - Enterprise-wide architectural overhaul:
- ‚úÖ **Pillar 1 (Atomicity)**: 100% complete - All transaction and P2002 patterns implemented + TESTED
- ‚è≥ **Pillar 2 (Performance)**: 11 tasks - Eliminate redundant queries, efficient resolvers
- ‚è≥ **Pillar 3 (Architecture)**: 14 tasks - SRP compliance, @AuditContext() decorator  
- ‚è≥ **Pillar 4 (Type Safety)**: 15 tasks - Remove all `any` types, GraphQL consistency

**GraphQL Enum Fixed**: ‚úÖ UserRole converted to String with CHECK constraint (December 23, 2025)
**Next**: Continue with Pillar 2 Performance optimization

## üìÅ NEW FILE STRUCTURE (IMPORTANT!)

**Documentation is now optimized and separated:**
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: AI context only (82 lines, 90% reduction achieved)
- **`docs/ENTERPRISE_STANDARDS.md`**: Complete SDLC policy (moved from CLAUDE.md)
- **`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`**: Centralized progress tracking
- **`todos/`**: Active TODO files for complex phases (currently: ARCHITECTURAL_REFACTORING_TODO.md)
- **`archived_md/`**: Completed phases and historical docs

**Context Window Optimized**: No overlap between files, clear separation of concerns
