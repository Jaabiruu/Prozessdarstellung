## üö® CRITICAL SAFETY RULES (UNCHANGED)

### **GIT OPERATIONS - CLAUDE IS BANNED**
- **YOU ARE FORBIDDEN from running ANY git commands**
- User will handle ALL: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
- After each major milestone, tell user EXACTLY what git commands to run

### **SAFETY PROTOCOL**
- Commit after EVERY major milestone
- Push immediately to GitHub
- Verify files exist on GitHub before continuing
- NO batch commits - commit frequently

### **ENTERPRISE STANDARDS COMPLIANCE**
- ALL code must follow the established SDLC Policy (13 sections)
- Use readonly interfaces, union types, secure configuration patterns
- Follow NestJS dependency injection patterns
- Implement proper error handling and logging

---

## üìã IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

### **YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK**:
1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** to understand current progress (should show 12% complete with Phase 1 done)
2. **Read `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`** to see Phase 1 completion and Phase 2 planning
3. **Start Phase 2.1**: Create Prisma schema with GxP-compliant models
4. **Follow SDLC Policy**: Use established enterprise standards for all code

### **DO NOT**:
- Skip reading current progress in CLAUDE.md
- Ignore enterprise standards established in Phase 1
- Create code that doesn't follow the SDLC Policy
- Implement authentication or GraphQL yet (Phase 3-4)

## üìû CONTEXT VERIFICATION QUESTIONS

**Ask yourself these questions to verify context understanding:**

1. ‚úÖ Do I understand Phase 1 is COMPLETE and Phase 2 is 83% COMPLETE?
2. ‚úÖ Do I know the current progress is 17% complete (16/150 items)?
3. ‚úÖ Do I understand I'm BANNED from git operations?
4. ‚úÖ Do I know I need to complete P2.5 Data Seeding and P2.6 Module Integration?
5. ‚úÖ Do I understand all code must follow the established SDLC Policy?
6. ‚úÖ Do I know the difference between ACTIVE docs vs REFERENCE specs?
7. ‚úÖ Do I understand the database foundation is complete and tested?

**If you answered YES to all 7 questions, you're ready to complete Phase 2.**

## üöÄ STARTUP COMMAND FOR NEW CLAUDE

**Say this to confirm context understanding:**

> "I understand the pharmaceutical system rebuild context. Phase 1 foundation is COMPLETE and Phase 2 database foundation is 83% COMPLETE with enterprise standards established (17% progress). The database schema, PrismaService, configuration, and migrations are all complete and tested. I need to complete the final Phase 2 tasks: P2.5 Data Seeding and P2.6 Module Integration, following the established SDLC Policy with readonly interfaces, union types, and proper enterprise patterns. I am banned from git operations. I will read CLAUDE.md and PHASE_2_PROGRESS.md to verify current progress, then complete the remaining Phase 2 tasks. Ready to finalize Phase 2 of the strategic rebuild."
