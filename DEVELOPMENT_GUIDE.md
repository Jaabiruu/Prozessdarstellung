# üõ†Ô∏è Development Guide - REBUILD EDITION

**Strategic rebuild development workflows for the pharmaceutical production management system**

---

## üö® REBUILD STATUS: INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY FOUNDATION REQUIRED

### **CURRENT STATUS: ‚ùå INFRASTRUCTURE INSECURE - P0.0 REQUIRED**

The system experienced complete code loss due to manual operations. Before ANY development begins, we must implement bulletproof infrastructure security to prevent future incidents.

**Root Cause**: Manual git operations on development server led to environment destruction  
**Solution**: Eliminate all manual operations through automation  
**Strategy**: Infrastructure-first rebuild with enterprise-grade security

---

## üõ°Ô∏è PHASE 0: INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY FOUNDATION (MANDATORY FIRST)

### **P0.0.1: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline - ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Purpose**: Eliminate manual deployments and server operations

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml (TO BE CREATED)
name: Pharmaceutical System CI/CD
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd apps/backend && npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: cd apps/backend && npm run test
      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: cd apps/backend && npm run test:e2e

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to environment
        run: echo "Automated deployment pipeline"
```

### **P0.0.2: Infrastructure as Code - ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Purpose**: Version-controlled environment definitions

```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml (TO BE CREATED)
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: pharma_control
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${DB_USER}"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
    command: redis-server --appendonly yes

  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:8.8.0
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
    volumes:
      - elasticsearch_data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  redis_data:
  elasticsearch_data:
```

### **P0.0.3: Branch Protection Rules - ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**GitHub Repository Settings Required**:
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
- ‚úÖ Restrict force pushes
- ‚úÖ Require signed commits (recommended)

### **P0.0.4: Zero Manual Operations Policy - ‚ùå NOT ESTABLISHED**

**Technical Controls**:
- Server SSH access restricted to CI/CD service accounts only
- Manual git operations prohibited on production/staging servers
- All deployments through automated pipelines
- Environment recreation fully automated from git repository

---

## üìã REBUILD DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (POST-P0.0)

### **Current Rebuild Approach**
1. **Infrastructure First**: Complete P0.0 before any code development
2. **Safety Protocols**: Frequent commits with immediate GitHub verification
3. **Specification-Driven**: Build against preserved original documentation
4. **Progress Tracking**: Update CLAUDE.md after every major milestone

### **Development Environment Setup (NOT YET AVAILABLE)**
```bash
# Will be available after P0.0 completion:
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Jaabiruu/Prozessdarstellung.git
cd Prozessdarstellung

# 2. Automated environment setup (via docker-compose)
docker-compose up -d  # Will start all services

# 3. Backend setup (when apps/backend exists)
cd apps/backend
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run seed

# 4. Development server
npm run start:dev  # Will be: http://localhost:3000/graphql
```

## üèóÔ∏è PLANNED ARCHITECTURE (TO BE REBUILT)

### **Technical Stack (TARGET)**
- **Core**: NestJS v11 + PostgreSQL + Prisma + GraphQL
- **Security**: JWT + RBAC + Helmet + pharmaceutical validators
- **Performance**: Redis + Elasticsearch + k6 testing framework
- **Monitoring**: Custom metrics + database monitoring + health checks
- **Testing**: Jest (100+ tests target) + E2E validation + Performance tests

### **GxP Compliance Architecture (ENHANCED DESIGN)**
```typescript
// ApprovalWorkflowService (NEW - Clean Architecture)
class ApprovalWorkflowService {
  async submitForApproval(entityId: string, userId: string): Promise<ApprovalWorkflow>
  async approve(workflowId: string, approverId: string): Promise<ApprovalWorkflow>
  async reject(workflowId: string, approverId: string, reason: string): Promise<ApprovalWorkflow>
}

// State Machine Pattern for Approval Transitions
enum ApprovalState {
  DRAFT = 'DRAFT',
  PENDING_APPROVAL = 'PENDING_APPROVAL',
  APPROVED = 'APPROVED', 
  REJECTED = 'REJECTED'
}
```
